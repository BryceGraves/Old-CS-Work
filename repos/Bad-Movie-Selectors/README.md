Bad Movie Selectors: I made some basic python scripts to help choose movies from a pre-made list for when you can't bring yourself to pick a horrible movie on your own.


To run these you need to have python installed on your path. Just download the repo, open up terminal, and head over to the folder. Just run the script and it will print the movie you should watch and remove it from the list.
