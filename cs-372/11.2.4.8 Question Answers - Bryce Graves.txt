Reflection
1. The password cisco command was entered for the console and VTY lines in your basic configuration in Part
	1. When is this password used after the best practice security measures have been applied?

The first password is no longer used after the new ones were added. Even though the original password is still present it is disabled once the login local command is issued.

2. Are preconfigured passwords shorter than 10 characters affected by the security passwords min-length 10
command.

Nope, passwords that are configured before the password limit is added are not subject to this limitation. Though if they are reconfigured they must be 10 characters in length.
